Position Description

The Digital, Data, and Design (D^3) Institute at Harvard is accepting applications for research associates to work on research activities at our newly formed research labs. D^3 launched in the summer of 2022 with 12 labs working on research at the intersection of academia and practice. For more information on D^3, please visit https://d3.harvard.edu.

The Research Associate will work under the direct supervision of faculty Principal Investigators and Lab Manager of each lab. D^3 is looking for candidates with diverse backgrounds and/or new perspectives. There are no teaching requirements for these open positions.

The Data Science & AI Operations (DSOps) Lab, incubating within the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard (LISH), led by HBS Professors Iavor Bojinov and Edward McFowland III, is seeking a Research Associate. The lab focuses on how companies develop data science capabilities throughout the entire pipeline, starting with the management questions, data collection and analysis phases, and final decision-making. Of particular interest are topics around building a data-first company, developing and deploying state-of-the-art causal inference and predictive algorithms, using experimentation platforms to drive organizational innovation, and other relevant research and managerial questions. The lab’s projects will be situated in research settings that are high-stakes and managerial in nature, where research questions and algorithmic developments focus on the intersection of joint human and algorithmic decision-making. Finally, we also explore how data science enables efficacy and scalability of new data-driven and algorithm-supported operating models, understanding if or when it is appropriate for algorithms to operate autonomously with (or without) human oversight.

Project Themes
Algorithm-in-the-loop decision-making,
The antecedents and consequences of human trust in algorithmic recommendations of managerial decisions,
Detecting and overcome biases in algorithmic and human decision-making,
Development of novel algorithms for causal inference,
The design and deployment of an experimentation platform and its impact on innovation.
Primary Duties
Coordinate research tasks with the lab’s academic partners and faculty internally at Harvard and at other research institutions as well as with companies;
Collect research data and make deductions and conclusions to share with faculty and other researchers;
Assist with building and evaluating data science algorithms through simulation, experimentation, and research articles;
Write briefs and summaries of research projects for public circulation;
Manage research information and data (including data cleaning);
Conduct other background research and literature reviews;
Support development of case studies, presentations, and convenings;
Manage various reviews of research protocols including the Institutional Review Board (IRB), data use agreements (DUA), and data security application process with lab researchers;
Other duties may be assigned.
Basic Qualifications
B.A. or B.S.; open to any field, but demonstrated experience with data science is required.
Additional Qualifications And Skills

The successful candidate will have excellent research and writing skills, be analytically-minded and possess strong conceptual skills; be at home in an academic environment; work well independently. The ideal candidate will have strong people skills and evidence of outstanding academic achievement.

Proven ability to handle multiple projects simultaneously and to flexibly adapt to changes in priorities; ability to work calmly under deadline pressure, work both independently and as a team member, take initiative; and follow projects through to completion.

Other Desirable Qualities Include
Ability to handle multiple projects, stakeholders, and demands.
Self-motivated with a desire to problem solve and learn new skills as needed.
Strong team player with excellent verbal and written communication skills.
Experience using statistical computer languages (R or Python).
Experience with machine learning algorithms.
Familiarity with causal inference techniques.
Experience with experimental design.
