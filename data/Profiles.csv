Summary
I am a skilled scientist versed in Python, statistical analysis, and
machine learning who understands the power of data to solve
problems, discover information, and uncover hidden patterns.  I
am keen to gain experience helping a business use data to solve
problems and make decisions. 
I have a Ph.D. in biology and previously worked as an academic
scientist.  I was drawn to biological research as a career because
I have a passion for asking questions, conducting experiments,
and synthesizing data.  Working as a biologist honed my skills
in designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, and
interpreting and communicating the results to stakeholders.
Intrigued by the possibilities of 'big data', I worked independently and
with a data science boot camp to acquire the technical tools used by
data analysts and data scientists.  I am now proficient in writing code
in Python, building machine learning pipelines, writing queries in
SQL, and creating visualizations with Tableau.  I have always been
an enthusiastic learner and have truly enjoyed immersing myself
in the data science field and creating various personal projects to
highlight my new skill set.  
I am currently working in my first data analytics position.  I bring
solid technical skills, well-developed soft skills, an “always learning”
attitude, and an eagerness to make an impact in my new industry
and career. 
I am happy to connect with fellow data enthusiasts so please reach

Summary
As a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion to leverage the
intersection of cutting-edge technology, human ingenuity, and Data
Science, I thrive on exploring the limitless possibilities of Artificial
Intelligence to solve complex problems and drive innovation. With
expertise in computer vision, natural language processing, and deep
learning, I am driven to develop intelligent systems that can learn
from data, recognize patterns, and make accurate predictions.
I have had the privilege of working on a wide range of projects,
from designing cutting-edge autonomous systems to developing
innovative predictive models for businesses across multiple
industries. 
Currently as a ML Engineer in a manufacturing industry, I am driven
to identify business needs on the production floor, work with cross-
functional teams and SMEs to form domain context and lead a
project to develop innovative capabilities. Whether it's building
scalable robust models from scratch, optimizing existing pipelines,
or collaborating with cross-functional teams to deploy ML solutions
at scale, I have applied machine learning skills to devise impactful
solutions on complex manufacturing processes. I leverage 'Big Data'
to enhance operational efficiency, streamline processes, and reduce

Summary
Hi! I’m Aron. I’m an AI scientist, engineering leader, and Former
Math Person. My happy place: working hard with brilliant people
to solve challenging problems that matter - by building world-class
teams and technology.
Currently, I head ML Products at PathAI - a team of 300+
spectacular AI researchers, software engineers, biomedical
scientists, and pathology experts, all working together to find novel,
AI-powered treatments and diagnostics to help people suffering from
diseases like cancer. (If that sounds as cool to you as it did to me,
come join us- we're hiring!)
In the past, I’ve led teams at Kensho Technologies, Harvard, the
Zerobase Foundation, and MarketFactory, fighting fake news,
Covid-19, and terrorism while approaching the speed of light. Ping
me to find out more :)
When not thinking about technology, I love playing cello and
ultimate frisbee, cooking, political modeling, and slowly but surely
approaching the perfect espresso shot.

ABOUT US
• We combine global knowledge expertise with data science to provide
clients a single marketplace to bring their questions and receive insights from
carefully curated experts – quickly, compliantly, and cost-effectively. Our
products allow clients to connect directly with the expert they need instead of
a generalist or an account manager. Independent professionals across the
world, from professors and CEOs to scientists and diplomats, deliver fresh
perspectives on a wide range of countries, markets, and industries.
• GlobalWonks set out to discover untapped or under-utilized experts and
make their knowledge available more quickly than ever before. We began
with the fundamental idea that organizations learning about a new issue never
want just one opinion, they want a comprehensive understanding of their topic.
Through our patented innovation, Network Pulse™, clients receive a range
of expert insights in real time. They then choose an expert to go deeper with
on a one-hour call or by commissioning a written report. Our agile pay per-
engagement model ensures cost efficiency and user empowerment no matter
where you are.
HOW IT ALL WORKS
• Ask a single question and GlobalWonks’ proprietary technology instantly
connects your submission to the most relevant experts around the world.
• Start receiving answers in real time.
• Stop there or go deeper with any expert you choose, through a one-hour call
or a written report.

ABOUT US
• We combine global knowledge expertise with data science to provide
clients a single marketplace to bring their questions and receive insights from
carefully curated experts – quickly, compliantly, and cost-effectively. Our
products allow clients to connect directly with the expert they need instead of
a generalist or an account manager. Independent professionals across the
world, from professors and CEOs to scientists and diplomats, deliver fresh
perspectives on a wide range of countries, markets, and industries.
• GlobalWonks set out to discover untapped or under-utilized experts and
make their knowledge available more quickly than ever before. We began
with the fundamental idea that organizations learning about a new issue never
want just one opinion, they want a comprehensive understanding of their topic.
Through our patented innovation, Network Pulse™, clients receive a range
of expert insights in real time. They then choose an expert to go deeper with
on a one-hour call or by commissioning a written report. Our agile pay per-
engagement model ensures cost efficiency and user empowerment no matter
where you are.
HOW IT ALL WORKS
• Ask a single question and GlobalWonks’ proprietary technology instantly
connects your submission to the most relevant experts around the world.
• Start receiving answers in real time.
• Stop there or go deeper with any expert you choose, through a one-hour call
or a written report.

Summary
Machine learning is the crossing point for the skills and interests
that I've developed throughout my student and professional
career: physics, mathematics, coding, philosophy, neurobiology,
and process automation; I will be building and investigating the
boundaries of this space until I retire, and beyond.
Like many powerful technologies, it has the capability of benefiting
the world or breaking it. My goal is to be designing systems that are
robust allies in a sea of massive data warehousing, unblinking eyes
in the right place to keep people safe and processes optimized, and
ethically sound methods of advancing the field.

Résumé
To remain competitive, companies must successfully combine their
employees’ expertise with artificial intelligence and innovate faster
than ever. 
My primary interest is to help achieve this vision within R&D
organizations. 
My journey so far has allowed me to contribute to this both on a
technical level as an individual contributor and now as a technical
program manager. 
As an individual contributor, I have developed algorithms for high-
throughout computation, designed physics-inspired neural network
architectures, and created new AI-based prescriptive modeling tools
to design materials and devices faster. 
In my current role, I lead a multidisciplinary team of product owners,
software engineers, UI/UX designers, and scientists to build and
deliver Corning’s materials informatics roadmap using agile practices
and FAIR data principles. 
My top strengths as identified by my colleagues are my ability to
think strategically to balance short-term priorities with long-term
viability, bring people together under a common vision, and break
down ambitious goals and challenging problems into solvable
pieces. 
My specialties are algorithm development, machine learning,
molecular simulations and agent-based modeling.  
I’m also passionate about giving back in meaningful ways. I
volunteer in several efforts including the creation of a national
  Page 1 of 3    
robotics competition in Haiti as well as various mentoring and hiring
activities targeting people from underrepresented backgrounds. 
Reach out to chat about AI for science, technical program
management, innovation and giving back in meaningful ways.

While performing my duties as an instrumentation and controls engineer intern,
I supported the optimization of field instruments management system leading
to better technology transfer for design and construction of new factories. I
also created and implemented an algorithm for control of complex closed-loop
water systems. This algorithm allows for an estimated 50% water savings,
increased efficiency and factory up-time. Lastly, I initiated the implementation
of a utility management system that will enable better utility usage monitoring
from a building/factory level all the way to individual piece of equipment level
allowing for increased operational efficiency.

As one of the wastes treatment systems was reaching maximum capacity and
additional investment were being considered, I created and validated a model
that helped optimize the operation of exhaust scrubbers allowing for up to
$2.4M costs avoidance and 50% wastestream reduction. I also performed an
audit and made recommendations for better operation of closed-loop process
cooling water systems leading to increased efficiency and better understanding
of system chemistry.
Pure Water for the World
Water Quality Technician
septembre 2010 - juin 2011  (10 mois)
In this capacity, I was responsible for quality control and assurance of all
field water treatment systems installed throughout the country. Water was
tested for microbiological, physical and chemical quality indicators, root
causes of deviations were determined and recommendations made to
prevent problems from happening again. I also supported engineers from
Dow Chemicals in the commissioning of two (2) modern water treatment
plants using Reverse Osmosis and Nano-filtration technologies along with
Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). I took ownership of commissioned
systems, trained technicians for daily operation and handled troubleshooting.

Summary
I am a Data Scientist who specializes in Machine Learning, Natural
Language Processing, Deep Learning, Statistics and Predictive
Modeling. I have a solid experience in the field of Data Mining and
am comfortable in both front-end and back-end technologies like
Python, Java, and SQL. I have always been drawn towards data
and the myriad possibilities it presents. Though a lifelong student of
data science, I’ve also had the opportunity to be a teaching assistant
for courses on Data Management Systems and Intermediate
Programming with Data at Northeastern University. I interned as
a Data Analyst with Spundhan where I consistently worked on
large datasets analyzing historic data to understand customer
segmentation, while also performing A/B Testing for B2C clients. I
helped them boost their revenues within two months. 
Over these years, I have managed to couple my understanding of
technology with effective communication and documentation skills. 
Every problem is a challenge that I love to take on with an analytical
approach and a pinch of creativity. I am looking for full time
opportunities as a Data Scientist where I can use these skills and
add value.

Summary
I have always loved figuring out how the technology of the modern
world works and finding ways to improve the human experience
through its application. My passion for learning and diving deep into
the process of discovery has never diminished. I want to collaborate
with the best minds to solve challenging problems and design the
future. 
My background is a bit different from a typical engineering graduate.
I came to university with 5 years of professional leadership
experience and I have spent my time on campus honing those skills.
I have guided the campus chapter of IEEE to new successes by
focusing on mentorship and professional training. The 2020/2021
move to online education was a challenge, but with the help of my
team of officers we were able to offer training on microcontrollers,
programming, resume building, and professional presentations. I
was even able to teach a lesson based on my Statistical Machine
Learning course, exposing other students to a fascinating and
growing field. Perhaps my greatest accomplishment was seeing one
of my officers take  the leadership mantle and continue to execute on
the organizational structure I had implemented, growing the chapter
and reaching new levels of success.
I am eager to join a team of professionals and work hard to help

Summary
I worked at Optimax Systems Inc. for 6 years part-time during my
undergrad. When I left, I was a robotics programming specialist and
worked on several different robotics platforms. I have experience
working with more than 30 different programming languages, but
the listed skills are the languages I can work with without refreshing.
At Optimax, I worked as a manual machinist, IT technician focused
on software and ERP development, and a Robotics specialist in
Research and Development.
I started at Corning as a Co-op through Pro Unlimited, a contracting
company, as a Controls and Mechanical Engineering Intern. There I
was developing system identification techniques for motor systems
using optimization, PID Autotuning using Optimization, and creating
automated calibration routines for one of their robotic platforms. I
was recently employed at Corning, where I hold the title Controls
Engineer. I work on automating some of the most complex problems
the company has in its advanced optics division. My day-to-day tasks
primarily consist of systems modeling projects and Machine learning
tasks.
I have an MS in Mechanical Engineering from Rochester Institute
of Technology, with a minor in computer science, and a minor in
applied mathematics. The Mechanical degree focused on controls
and simulations. The Computer Science minor was focused on
machine learning and AI, and the Mathematics Minor focused on
Stats, Optimization, and Computational Mathematics.
I also have some publications on Scaling-up freeform manufacturing,
and one for smoothing of mid-spatial frequencies using robotic
platforms, see links. My MS was published through ProQuest, and is
linked below as well.

My Thesis proposes a landing position validation system for a UAS. The
system is to be implemented on a Flying-Ambulance type vehicle, utilized in
highly urban areas. By using modern CV techniques, I gather distance data
from the ground and use that as a means to determine the optimal location
to land, if such a location exists. Otherwise, move forward or backward to try
and identify a new potential location to land. My tuition has been waived and I
received a stipend for my work.

Neuro-transmission is an intricate process involving an interplay between
electric impulses and chemical transfer between neurons.
For my doctoral research I conducted research on theoretical and numerical
modelling of biological membrane fusion under the influence of SNARE
proteins in extremely specific physiological conditions. My primary focus was
on synaptic vesicle fusion and docking aspect of neuro-transmission. 
I developed rigorous analytical and computational models to capture
mechanics of cell membrane deformation and pinned down the optimal
requirements for a successful neurotransmission. I used coarse-grained
molecular simulations to capture the molecular details of the membrane fusion
and understand the underlying steps of the fusion process.  
My doctoral work is published in three impactful journal articles.

Development of Graphene Mid-IR detectors
PhD Thesis Title: Low Dimensional Carbon Electronics
My PhD thesis work focused on carbon electronics, specifically carbon
nanotubes and graphene. 
-Developed a quantum bit by electrostatically controlling the spin of a single
electron. This involved growing carbon nanotubes, characterizing them, and
fabricating complex nanoscale structures around them with electron beam
lithography and other semiconductor techniques and tools. In order to measure
single electron processes, I used a combination of high sensitivity electronics
and milli-kelvin temperatures in a dilution refrigerator.
-Created a graphene photodetector for far infrared (IR) radiation. These are
wavelengths difficult to detect with conventional technologies. We utilized a
novel thermoelectric property of graphene and by creating a p-n junction in a
graphene ribbon with electrostatic gates, we were able to make a thermopile
with high sensitivity to far IR radiation. Characterizing these devices involved
creating a confocal scanning laser microscopic for the far IR range which
required specialized optics, complex control software and methods to suppress
vibration and electronic noise.

Summary
I believe that passion, punctuality, and diligence are the traits that
reflect me the most as an individual. My background in sports makes
me a team player. I believe that for a project to be successful,
the whole team needs to have the same goal and work towards
achieving it every day. 
With the resources being limited for every organization, it is
important to ensure that every process is done optimally and thus I
chose Operations Research as my major. Operations Research is a
field of mathematics that helps us to arrive at optimal or near-optimal
solutions to complex decision-making problems by employing
techniques such as mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and
mathematical optimization.

As VP of Data Scientist at Gesture, I head a team of 8 data scientists who
are responsible for engineering the company’s data ETL (Extract, Transform,
Load) pipeline. Namely, I developed the infrastructure which automatically
pulls transactional data from Google Firebase, securely stores it in analytical
format on Google BigQuery, and thereafter generates KPI dashboards for the
executive team in Tableau.
In addition to monitoring the company in real-time, I develop AI solutions
to inform business decisions driving growth via new customer acquisition,
consumer choice diversification, and new market entry. To do so, we
employ python-backed machine learning libraries including SciKit Learn and
Tensorflow to conduct predictive analytics. Our techniques are now being used
to improve the customer experience and optimize the company’s operational

2030 Agenda from any country in the world. On behalf of UN delegations, I
negotiated the terms of the Agenda's Sustainable Development Goals, which
streamline social, economic, and environmental cooperation by governments,
the private sector, and civil society.
In parallel, I also negotiated the Financing for Development framework,
which serves to fund development initiatives through intense public-private
partnerships and with focus on the world's most vulnerable constituencies.
I also advised on the Paris Climate Agreement and helped to organize Climate
Summit 2014 with the UN Office for Partnerships, which served as the seminal
precursor to the most ambitious emissions-reduction framework now adopted
by the international community.
I was the face of delegations including the Permanent Missions of Panama
and the Sovereign Order of Malta to the United Nations, publicly representing
them in the General Assembly, the Security Council, and various UN agencies
and chambers, as well as in speech writing.

of leading scientists, engineers, and negotiation experts to draft policy
recommendations to peacefully resolve the threat of armed conflict arising from
the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam's construction.
Four months following our delivery, the three governments issued the first ever
""Declaration of Principles"" for peaceful cooperation along the Nile, reflecting
the recommendations of the Working Group.

Summary
I am a researcher in Computer Vision and Deep Learning, currently
pursuing my MS in Computer Science from Khoury College at
Northeastern University. My interests involve Computer Vision
and Perception Systems, harnessing Deep Learning to solve
real business challenges, ML pipeline development in production
environment, and optimizing model inference times so that they can
be used online in time-critical systems.
During the pandemic I focused on self-learning and researching, and
I have taken several courses from Udacity and Coursera, ranging
from topics like Business Leadership (my long term goal) to Deep
Neural Networks (my medium-term goal). Much of my motivation
for pursuing a degree in Computer Science is being able to solve
problems at a societal level, things that alters and improves the
lifestyles of people in our society. To me, that is the purpose of
Science itself.
Autonomous vehicles is one such application that I find exciting and
something that can have wide ranging impact on the society. Not
only would things like this save lives lost to reckless / inebriated
driving, it also opens up opportunities to streamline traffic
automatically in a swarm system which can enable much faster
movement of traffic in city streets. This drives my interest in working
with Self Driving Cars as a Perception / Deep Learning Engineer.
Overall, I wish to contribute my skills towards enabling a positive
social change using technologies that will potentially shape the
future.

Summary
I’m a UX Designer with a passion for visual design, and a focus on
the people who need it. I execute cohesive, creative concepts that
solve user problems 
In a past life, I studied biological anthropology before following
some dreams to become a painter. My paintings capture the unique
experiences of the eccentric people I encountered. Now, instead of
painting experiences, I also design them. I design tools that make
interacting with technology more intuitive, effective, and aesthetically
pleasing.

Abstract Artist & Vintage Seller
Thomaston, Maine, United States
Summary
Before graduating with honors from New York University, I served
as assistant to documentary filmmakers, Tisch professors, and as
a receptionist at three university residence halls, fielding phone
calls, packages, visitors, residents, and building management. My
insatiable interest in media studies and pop culture propelled the
spirit of my academic program, and I completed courses concerning
cultural symbols, film language, television history, drawing, painting,
costume design, and screen performance. 
Beginning in high school I have worked on-and-off as an eBay seller
of well-preserved vintage toys and garments; later launching an Etsy
store, now in redevelopment, to independently represent my art and
unique retro finds, with additional sales generated in sales of luxury
throws offered by Maine-based EPiC Yarns. 
In L.A., I interned at Warner Brothers for Silver Pictures and
established my own production company – my contributions as a
producer, director, writer and actor in the deliberately kitschy web-
series ""Stake This!"" can be viewed on YouTube.  
My painting and modeling portfolios are also available for review.
Eager to learn new skills and forge strong contacts, I confidently
believe I would bring style, quality, imagination, and warmth to any
endeavor.
Specialties:  Training in the visual arts (drawing and painting,
collage, cinema studies, costume design, photography).  Online
sales (eBay, Etsy) and in-store retail.  Familiarity with social media
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).  Fine penmanship, gift wrapping,
and flower arrangement skills.  Strong sense of style & design (with
knowledge of fashion history and vintage clothing).  Small plate food
prep and presentation.  Pet, plant, and house care services.

MS Computer Science Student at Northeastern University
Fremont, California, United States
Summary
I’m a Venezuelan graduate student in Computer Science from
Northeastern University. I have an associate degree in Graphic
Design and worked for 3 years in Web Design and Development. In
2014, I decided to come to the United States to pursue my bachelors
in 3D Modeling for Games. While working as a 3D modeler, I
realized I wanted to be more involved in the engineering aspects
of my field, eventually this led me to pursue a master in Computer
Science. My current goals are to learn as much as I can from the
program, industry experts, and my peers, and ultimately get the
opportunity to do a co-op/internship to further acquire knowledge and
experience.

Summary
I enjoy showing my art in the Kansas City and surrounding area.
I promote color therapy, art therapy and donate art supplies to
shelters, boys and girls clubs, adult rehabilitation centers and
Salvation Army. My main goal is to show my art to the eyes and
hearts of people. I am shy but started showing on Instagram a
couple years ago and thankfully the art truly shows itself. I am a
surrealist and also use music for art stimulation. I greatly enjoy
painting and drawing in a traditional, original and  surreal fashion.
At times I feel I am from the past…or maybe the future because
my art is so very strange, but my delivery comes ultimately from
my imagination. I pull emotion from situations and nature… I dive
into the subject I have in mind and create with a surgical touch. I
paint anything from ancient ships to hummingbirds, Angels, fairies,
monsters, eyeball portraits from a  person, in reflection of their own
personality. I custom and commission at times if an agreement is
made. I love exploring all area’s of art. I work with all mediums. Enjoy
my entire show on Instagram @StrangeArtKC101 gallery show for
free. Please follow the fun action I’m now intertwined in. I follow the
art. I deliver the image to the canvas. Artist at ♥️ I can paint for you.
