  Page 1 of 4    
San Francisco Bay Area
I led the Smart Computing Architecture Team, where we focused on using
machine learning to improve CPU performance.  We were the first to develop
CNNs for branch prediction and to show practical implementations of machine
learning algorithms for dynamic, post-silicon CPU adaptation. 
I was also the lead on several other research initiatives, including:
- NLP at Scale (Advanced Research and Technology Development Group),
where I focused on system architectures and algorithms for distributed training
of large Transformer models;
- Compilation for Non-von Neumann Architectures (Microarchitecture
Research Lab), where I was responsible for the very first API and compiler for
Loihi, Intel’s neuromorphic research chip;
- ML in Edge Computing (Microarchitecture Research Lab), where I developed
practical, low-power sparse approximation algorithms for use on edge devices.

Abstract Artist & Vintage Seller
Thomaston, Maine, United States
Summary
Before graduating with honors from New York University, I served
as assistant to documentary filmmakers, Tisch professors, and as
a receptionist at three university residence halls, fielding phone
calls, packages, visitors, residents, and building management. My
insatiable interest in media studies and pop culture propelled the
spirit of my academic program, and I completed courses concerning
cultural symbols, film language, television history, drawing, painting,
costume design, and screen performance. 
Beginning in high school I have worked on-and-off as an eBay seller
of well-preserved vintage toys and garments; later launching an Etsy
store, now in redevelopment, to independently represent my art and
unique retro finds, with additional sales generated in sales of luxury
throws offered by Maine-based EPiC Yarns. 
In L.A., I interned at Warner Brothers for Silver Pictures and
established my own production company – my contributions as a
producer, director, writer and actor in the deliberately kitschy web-
series ""Stake This!"" can be viewed on YouTube.  
My painting and modeling portfolios are also available for review.
Eager to learn new skills and forge strong contacts, I confidently
believe I would bring style, quality, imagination, and warmth to any
endeavor.
Specialties:  Training in the visual arts (drawing and painting,
collage, cinema studies, costume design, photography).  Online
sales (eBay, Etsy) and in-store retail.  Familiarity with social media
(Twitter, Facebook, Instagram).  Fine penmanship, gift wrapping,
and flower arrangement skills.  Strong sense of style & design (with
knowledge of fashion history and vintage clothing).  Small plate food
prep and presentation.  Pet, plant, and house care services.

ABOUT US
• We combine global knowledge expertise with data science to provide
clients a single marketplace to bring their questions and receive insights from
carefully curated experts – quickly, compliantly, and cost-effectively. Our
products allow clients to connect directly with the expert they need instead of
a generalist or an account manager. Independent professionals across the
world, from professors and CEOs to scientists and diplomats, deliver fresh
perspectives on a wide range of countries, markets, and industries.
• GlobalWonks set out to discover untapped or under-utilized experts and
make their knowledge available more quickly than ever before. We began
with the fundamental idea that organizations learning about a new issue never
want just one opinion, they want a comprehensive understanding of their topic.
Through our patented innovation, Network Pulse™, clients receive a range
of expert insights in real time. They then choose an expert to go deeper with
on a one-hour call or by commissioning a written report. Our agile pay per-
engagement model ensures cost efficiency and user empowerment no matter
where you are.
HOW IT ALL WORKS
• Ask a single question and GlobalWonks’ proprietary technology instantly
connects your submission to the most relevant experts around the world.
• Start receiving answers in real time.
• Stop there or go deeper with any expert you choose, through a one-hour call
or a written report.

Summary
Hi! I’m Aron. I’m an AI scientist, engineering leader, and Former
Math Person. My happy place: working hard with brilliant people
to solve challenging problems that matter - by building world-class
teams and technology.
Currently, I head ML Products at PathAI - a team of 300+
spectacular AI researchers, software engineers, biomedical
scientists, and pathology experts, all working together to find novel,
AI-powered treatments and diagnostics to help people suffering from
diseases like cancer. (If that sounds as cool to you as it did to me,
come join us- we're hiring!)
In the past, I’ve led teams at Kensho Technologies, Harvard, the
Zerobase Foundation, and MarketFactory, fighting fake news,
Covid-19, and terrorism while approaching the speed of light. Ping
me to find out more :)
When not thinking about technology, I love playing cello and
ultimate frisbee, cooking, political modeling, and slowly but surely
approaching the perfect espresso shot.

Summary
I enjoy showing my art in the Kansas City and surrounding area.
I promote color therapy, art therapy and donate art supplies to
shelters, boys and girls clubs, adult rehabilitation centers and
Salvation Army. My main goal is to show my art to the eyes and
hearts of people. I am shy but started showing on Instagram a
couple years ago and thankfully the art truly shows itself. I am a
surrealist and also use music for art stimulation. I greatly enjoy
painting and drawing in a traditional, original and  surreal fashion.
At times I feel I am from the past…or maybe the future because
my art is so very strange, but my delivery comes ultimately from
my imagination. I pull emotion from situations and nature… I dive
into the subject I have in mind and create with a surgical touch. I
paint anything from ancient ships to hummingbirds, Angels, fairies,
monsters, eyeball portraits from a  person, in reflection of their own
personality. I custom and commission at times if an agreement is
made. I love exploring all area’s of art. I work with all mediums. Enjoy
my entire show on Instagram @StrangeArtKC101 gallery show for
free. Please follow the fun action I’m now intertwined in. I follow the
art. I deliver the image to the canvas. Artist at ♥️ I can paint for you.

Kansas City, Missouri, United States. Summary. I enjoy showing my art in the Kansas City and surrounding area.. I promote color therapy, art therapy and donate art supplies to. shelters, boys and girls clubs, adult rehabilitation centers and. Salvation Army. My main goal is to show my art to the eyes and. hearts of people. I am shy but started showing on Instagram a. couple years ago and thankfully the art truly shows itself. I am a. surrealist and also use music for art stimulation. I greatly enjoy. painting and drawing in a traditional, original and  surreal fashion.. At times I feel I am from the past…or maybe the future because. my art is so very strange, but my delivery comes ultimately from. my imagination. I pull emotion from situations and nature… I dive. into the subject I have in mind and create with a surgical touch. I. paint anything from ancient ships to hummingbirds, Angels, fairies,. monsters, eyeball portraits from a  person, in reflection of their own. personality. I custom and commission at times if an agreement is. made. I love exploring all area’s of art. I work with all mediums. Enjoy. my entire show on Instagram @StrangeArtKC101 gallery show for. free.

Summary
Machine learning is the crossing point for the skills and interests
that I've developed throughout my student and professional
career: physics, mathematics, coding, philosophy, neurobiology,
and process automation; I will be building and investigating the
boundaries of this space until I retire, and beyond.
Like many powerful technologies, it has the capability of benefiting
the world or breaking it. My goal is to be designing systems that are
robust allies in a sea of massive data warehousing, unblinking eyes
in the right place to keep people safe and processes optimized, and
ethically sound methods of advancing the field.
